## Description

This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes using an express backend while saving and retrieving note data from a JSON file. The front end was provided by GA Tech Bootcamp and I was tasked with creating the back end.

## Usage

When the application opens, you are taken to the title page. 
Once the user clicks the "Get Started" button, they are navigated to the notes page where they can write their notes.  
Once the note is written, click the save button and your note will appear in a list on the left side of the screen.  
At any time, the user can click on a note in the list on the left, and that note will appear on the page again. 
If the user would like to then write another note, they can click the write icon. Once the user wishes to delete a note, they click the delete icon next to the corresponding note.
